# DSA TEST 2024

This  Data  science test for dsa africa for summer workshop  itwas fun to do it.
It had tricks  and challenges that made learning data science more interactive.

It made me rethink of  ways to accomplish given task. I had a lot of fun doing this test , so i would recommend anyone who is interested in to register here before deadline and try it out

## Question on 3 NEAREST WAS BIT challenging

Also i noticed that example out expected on the notes or instructions is not accurate if anyone do in it look out for those . eg question 11 last  part 😁😁😀😂😁


Though it was Fun.
